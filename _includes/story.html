First I was taught in C/C++ as it is the main language used for numerical problem solving in my degree. In 2018 I got a summer course as an ASP .NET Core web developer. 
I found building web applications very entertaining but also felt I wanted to try something different where I could also apply what I learned at university regarding maths and physics. <br>
In 2019 I was an intern at NTT Data for 6 months. I was part of the Artificial Intelligence team in a knowledge management project named Everis Knowler where our main goal was to deploy, maintain and improve recommender systems for the product. 
There I had to improve my Python skills and more importantly I learnt about some very powerful libraries like Pandas or NumPy. Also it was very useful to learn about agile methodologies and how big teams organize in large companies.

Right now I am studying a MSc in Artificial Intelligence and I am working as a junior machine learning enginer at NTT Data.
