  My BSc final thesis consisted on applying neural networks to find the fundamental state of a quantum many-body system.
  Basically, I made use of a library named NetKet (https://www.netket.org) to make a simple NN structure, like a RBM or a FFNN, learn the fundamental state of a given quantum many-body system through Monte Carlo sampling data. 
  The plan was to study a couple of different hamiltonians and check how these ML methods can be useful applied to physics, and what can we expect from them.

  <p style="text-align:justify" class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">
  During my first 2-3 years at NTT Data I built several recommenders, processed lots of documents, profiled lots of users and built lots of microservices. 
  Got to work with ontologies and graph databases, which are quite interesting, wrote tons of ElasticSearch queries, touched some Spacy pipelines and even helped with the custom search engine of the product.
  Learnt a lot about containerization and DevOps.
  <br>
  On my 3rd-4th year I got involved in a new product idea, which we had to validate, do some PoCs, pivot, and finally build the MVP.
  There I got lots of experience and more responsabilities on different things as we were a very small team. 
  Got more experienced with DevOps, CI/CD, unsupervised learning, feature stores...
  <br>
  Lately I am also helping in a product that wraps several LLMs and provides a question-answering platform based on corporate documents.

  <p style="text-align:justify" class="f4 mb-4 {% if site.style == 'dark' %}text-white{% else %}text-gray{% endif %}">
  I studied a very general MSc in artificial intelligence which gave me the opportunity to learn and practice about a wide set of ML fields.
  Optimization algorithms, supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, computer vision, NLP...

  My final thesis consisted on building an end-to-end upselling and cross-selling system. I got a dataset with information from about 700K customers from an insurance company, and worked on my own to:

    <li>Deploy and serve both models in the public Cloud</li>
